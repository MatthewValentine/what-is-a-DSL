# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?

This language is for artists with a computational bent, or vice-versa.

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?

The language is very good at creating recursive images with a lot of shapes in a pattern.
This means that the images often end up being mathematical and abstract, although that is just a tendency.
It is good at this because recursive patterns are essentially the main point of the language.

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?

The language is not good at creating images that are mostly unpatterned, such as sketches.
Also, compared to many other forms of art, it does not allow you instant feedback on what you are doing.
Nor can you "draw" directly; you must trial-and-error with coordinates.

## How did you learn how to program in this language?

By looking at the documentation and a very few examples. I wouldn't say I've actually learned
how to program in the language though.

## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language? 
_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model". 
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of what 
happens when a ContextFree program runs._

Evaluating a ContextFree program is something like a breadth-first search.
Creating a shape adds some primitive, finished shapes to the drawing, and
also several non-primitive shapes that still need to be evaluated.

## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?

N/A: I did not write a program.
